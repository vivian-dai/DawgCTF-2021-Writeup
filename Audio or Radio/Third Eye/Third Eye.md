## Approach

Use [this site](https://convert.ing-now.com/audio-spectrogram-creator/) to convert the audio file to an image. Here's the image:

![hex](./hex.png)

These look like hex values: 44 61 77 67 43 54 46 7b 73 79 6e 33 73 74 68 33 73 31 61 63 73 7d

Use any method to [convert hex to ascii](https://www.rapidtables.com/convert/number/hex-to-ascii.html) and that's the flag.
